### CCF registration
- We performed registration of each STARmap PLUS slice with [Allen CCF v3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32386544/)
- To match each STARmap PLUS slice to their corresponding CCF slices, we employed the [AP_histology package](https://github.com/petersaj/AP_histology) and made some adjustations.
- The analysis include the following steps:
  -   [Annotate]()
  -   [Display]()
  -   [Get cell region ID labels]()
  -   [Get cell region parent ID labels]()
